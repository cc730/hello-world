About Christy

How did I end up here? Sort of by accident. 

Hubby gets graduate assistantship in Ohio. I find I enjoy creating publications.
We move back to Maryland. I attend University of Baltimore's Publication Design program and work as a receptionist.
I take some web design classes and help on a web design project at work.
Babies are born. I quit my job to raise them.
I got bored.
I started learning WordPress/HTML/CSS to entertain myself (and knitting, photography, crocheting, jewelry-making, etc.).
I became a volunteer for Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts and our local arts council and remembered how to talk to adults.
I got a job working the reference desk at our local library.
I mentioned that I have some experience with WordPress/HTML/CSS and take over updating the library's old website.
I redesign that website into a modern, section 508-compliant, responsive, Drupal site.
I redesign a local database maintained by the library.
